## Setting Up Your Own Matrix Server with Synapse and Docker Compose

This guide will walk you through deploying your own Matrix server using Synapse and Docker Compose. A Matrix server allows you to participate in the decentralized communication network known as Matrix.

**Prerequisites:**

* Docker installed and running on your system.
* A basic understanding of Docker Compose.
* Docker swarm setup.

**Steps:**

1. **Generate a Configuration File:**

   - Open a terminal window.
   - Run the following command, replacing `matrix.kusala.tech` with your desired server name:

     ```bash
     docker run -it --rm \
         -v "$(pwd)/synapse-data:/data" \
         -e SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME=matrix.kusala.tech \
         -e SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS=no \
         matrixdotorg/synapse:latest generate
     ```

   - This command generates a basic configuration file named `homeserver.yaml` in the current directory (`$(pwd)`) inside a subfolder named `synapse-data`. This volume will persist your data between container restarts.

2. **Customize the Configuration File (homeserver.yaml):**

   - Open the `homeserver.yaml` file in a text editor.
   - Edit the following settings as needed:
     - **SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME:** Ensure it matches your desired server address (already set in the command).
     - **Database Configuration:** Choose between SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL for the database and configure the connection details.
     - **Federation:** Enable or disable federation and configure federation partners if desired.
     - **Security:** Consider enabling TLS, rate limiting, and other security measures.
     - **Logging:** Configure logging levels and destinations for debugging purposes.
     - **Worker Processes:** Adjust the number of worker processes based on your server's resources.

   - Refer to the official Synapse documentation for detailed information on configuration options: [https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html)

3. **Start the Matrix Server:**

   - In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Run the following command to start the Synapse container:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

   - The `-d` flag instructs Docker Compose to run the service in detached mode, allowing the terminal to be closed without stopping the container.

4. **Verify Functionality:**

   - Once the container is running, you can access your Matrix server's web interface at `http://localhost:8008`. However, additional configuration might be required to use the server.
   - Refer to the Synapse documentation for further instructions on setting up users and managing your Matrix server.

**Additional Notes:**

* This guide provides a basic setup for a Matrix server. Security best practices like enabling TLS and using strong passwords are highly recommended.
* Consider using a separate volume for media storage if you anticipate a large volume of uploads.
* Regularly back up your `synapse-data` volume to avoid data loss.

This guide should help you get started with your own Matrix server using Synapse and Docker Compose. Remember to customize the configuration file and explore the Synapse documentation for more advanced features and configurations.
